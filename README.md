# midsprint

A small package that accompanies the Big Data Bowl 2021 submission "5 Seconds or Less: Modeling player biomechanics to predict pass outcomes"

### The Package

This package allows you to:
* Profile players
* Plot Speed-Acceleration curves
* Compare athletes' Speed-Acceleration curves

This package will be updated to provide more functionality including:
* Modeling which athlete will travel a given distance faster
* Potential player match-ups

*midsprint* requires one dependency: lamW. The package was written predominantly in base R to avoid it breaking with package updates
